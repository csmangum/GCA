# GCA

Generative Cellular Automata

## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of a Generative Cellular Automata (GCA) in Python. The GCA is a 1D cellular automata that uses a neural network to determine the next state of each cell. The neural network is a model that takes the current state of a cell and the states of its neighbors as input and returns the next state of the cell. The GCA is a generalization of the traditional cellular automata, which use a fixed rule to determine the next state of each cell.

## Usage

To define the rule you want to run, first change the settings.py file to the desired parameters. Then, run the main.py file. The results will be saved in the results folder.
